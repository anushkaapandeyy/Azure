# ☁️ Azure Access Request System (CRARS)

Welcome to the Azure Access Request System repository! This project is a full-stack application that allows users to request access to Azure resources and enables administrators to approve or reject those requests with automatic RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) assignment using Azure SDK.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

A hands-on project that:

- Uses **Terraform** to provision core Azure infrastructure
- Hosts a **Node.js (Express)** backend with Azure SDK integration
- Features a **React.js** frontend with a modern UI for users and admins
- Implements **Azure RBAC** role assignments dynamically
- Provides **audit logging** and **role validation**

## 🚀 Features

### 🌐 User Portal

- Simple form to request access to Azure subscriptions
- Role selection: Reader, Contributor, Owner
- Justification field for approvals

### 🔒 Admin Dashboard

- View pending requests
- Approve with automatic Azure RBAC assignment
- Reject with reason tracking
- Audit trail for every action

### ⚙️ Azure RBAC Integration

- Uses `@azure/arm-authorization` SDK
- Supports assigning built-in roles via Azure API
- UUID (`uuidv4()`) used to generate unique role assignment IDs

### 📊 Infrastructure Monitoring

- Log Analytics Workspace for centralized logging
- Cost alerting using Azure Monitor

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions


1. Clone the project
```bash
git clone 

2. Configure Environment Variables
cd backend
cp .env
# Edit .env with:
# AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, USER_PRINCIPAL_ID (or implement lookup)
# COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT, COSMOS_DB_KEY

3. Install Dependencies 
# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../access-request-frontend
npm install

4. Authenticate with Azure
az login
az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>

5. Deploy Azure Infra
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

6. Start the App
# Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Frontend (in new terminal)
cd access-request-frontend
npm start

📌 Role Assignment Details
Role Definitions Supported
Role	Definition ID
Reader	acdd72a7-3385-48ef-bd42-f606fba81ae7
Contributor	b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c
Owner	8e3af657-a8ff-443c-a75c-2fe8c4bcb635

Why UUID is Used
Each role assignment in Azure requires a unique ID

The backend uses uuidv4() to generate this ID when creating assignments

This is not the user ID or role ID — it is the role assignment object's ID, which is a unique identifier required by Azure to track each role assignment independently.

The Azure SDK (@azure/arm-authorization) is used to make authorized API calls to Azure, allowing us to:

Create RBAC assignments programmatically

Pass the UUID as the roleAssignmentName in the roleAssignments.create() method

Provide the necessary scope, principalId, and roleDefinitionId

Additionally, this project uses Azure Cosmos DB as the backend database to store access requests. Cosmos DB stores details like:

User ID

Requested Role

Subscription ID

Justification

Status (pending, approved, rejected)

Timestamps and audit metadata

Cosmos DB is ideal here due to its flexible schema, low latency, and global availability, making it perfect for scalable access tracking.

🔐 Security Practices
CORS enabled for frontend-backend communication

Input validation on API endpoints

Logging of actions for audit trail

Admin-only actions protected (authentication recommended in production)

🧪 Testing
Submitting a Request
Fill the form in the user portal and submit

Approving a Request
Switch to admin dashboard

Approve the request to trigger Azure role assignment

Rejecting a Request
Reject with an optional reason

🛠 Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
USER_PRINCIPAL_ID not set	Set manually or implement email-to-ID lookup via Microsoft Graph
RBAC assignment failed	Ensure service principal has "User Access Administrator" role
Cosmos DB errors	Check connection string in .env
CORS issues	Confirm backend has CORS enabled (dev mode allows all origins)

📈 Success Criteria
✅ Users can request access with proper validation

✅ Admins can approve and assign Azure RBAC roles

✅ Terraform successfully provisions infrastructure

✅ Cosmos DB stores all access requests

✅ Modern, responsive UI works across devices
